# Welcome to the Super Secret Santa Workshop App (SSSWA)
As Santa believes in the Open Source ideology, he has therefore uploaded the entire source code of the Super Secret Santa Workshop App - the App which makes delivering presents around the world possible.

## Getting started
First, we must set up environment variables.

CHARACTER_SEVEN = 'g'
NEXT_WEBSITE = 'https://'

## Running the App
Coming soon (Santa needs to figure out how to commit all his code first - I'm sure the stackoverflow elves will help out)
